  <br><center><p>Our civilization, the Rakha island, has a direct democracy, which we took from Athens, with women as senates to make our government decisions. Another thing that we took from athens was there style of religion, which was polytheism. We allow everyone to become a citizens, if you are an immigrant then you must serve in the military. This proves loyalty and trustworthiness. The direct democracy, with women senate, immigration policy, and a religion to bring civilians together causes everyone to have a say in their government, and causes less revolutions or rebellions, with protection from invaders.</p><center><br>
