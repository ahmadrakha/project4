<center><h3><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Barcelona Is a better club because they produce players that are individually<br> better than players from Real. Barcelona has players that are mostly from their own academy,<br> meaning they have players closer to the club. Messi is an example of how their players are<br> loyal because he has only been in two teams, Barcelona B,<br> And the First Barcelona team. He is one of many players that are loyal to the team.<br> Real madrid on the other hand is convinced that the game is run by money.<br> They bought one of the best players on their team<br> (Luis Figo) which was a big disappointment, because this changed the game into<br> whoever has the most money wins.</h3></center>
